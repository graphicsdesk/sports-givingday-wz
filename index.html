  Columbia Athletics raised $4,362,234 Tuesday on Giving Day with a total of 4,346 gifts. Women’s basketball led fundraising with $422,438.21 raised, and fencing took in the most individual gifts at 591.

  Athletics out-earned all other Columbia institutions, outpacing the totals of Columbia College by $1,092,035 and Barnard by $2,890,760. Giving Day, which was first held in 2012, is Columbia’s 24-hour annual fundraising event. Despite the 3 percent decrease from last year’s <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2024/10/11/columbia-athletics-sets-new-record-with-451-million-raised-on-giving-day/">record-breaking</a> $4,513,871 raised, 2025 is Athletics’ second largest Giving Day in history.

  Women’s basketball, coming off its <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2025/03/20/womens-basketball-earns-first-ncaa-tournament-victory-in-program-history-takes-down-washington/">most successful</a> season in program history, had a historic Giving Day, surpassing the previous year’s haul by $81,724.33 across 199 donations. Despite raising the most money, women’s basketball only ranked fifth in the number of individual donations, suggesting that many were higher dollar contributions.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Football, the highest earner in 2024’s Giving Day, ranked second this year, raising $349,205. This marked a steep drop-off for the 2024 Ivy League <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2024/11/23/football-beats-cornell-keeping-the-lions-in-contention-for-ivy-league-title/">champions</a>, falling from last year’s $431,026.85. Cross country and track and field had the third highest donation total, raising $294,025.26 in a 41 percent increase from 2024.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Thirteen teams raised less money than last year. Women’s golf donations fell dramatically from $116,662.42 in 2024 to just $75,000 on Tuesday, the sharpest decrease among the Division I teams.
</p>

  Baseball had a strong Giving Day following its Ivy League tournament <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2025/05/23/baseball-wins-ivy-league-tournament-clinches-ncaa-bid/">victory</a> this year, raising $238,796.54, a significant jump from last year’s $186,135. Men’s basketball, ahead of its upcoming season under the <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2025/03/24/kevin-hovde-announced-as-new-mens-basketball-head-coach/">new leadership</a> of head coach Kevin Hovde, took in $213,232 across just 50 donations. Up from $126,245 in 2024, this was the largest increase in donation totals.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Volleyball, which has struggled competitively in the Ivy League over the last few seasons, raised the least of the Division I teams, only earning $22,064 from 104 donations. This was less than women’s club rugby raised, managing $26,865 with 163 contributions.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Prior to 2024, Athletics’ highest Giving Day fundraising year was 2018 with $4,125,563.74. This was followed by a sharp drop-off in 2019, and fundraising numbers were similarly low during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, Athletics has raised an amount within the $4 million range for the second year in a row, a positive sign for Athletics in its efforts to build up its community and alumni donor networks.

  Athletic Director Peter Pilling thanked the Athletics community for its contributions in a Wednesday news<a href="https://gocolumbialions.com/news/2025/10/22/general-columbia-athletics-raises-over-4-4-million-on-columbia-giving-day.aspx"> release</a>.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We are incredibly thankful for the outpouring of support from our Columbia Athletics community,” Pilling said. “Year after year, our alumni, parents, and friends continue to step up in remarkable ways. Their generosity continues to provide our student-athletes with an exceptional experience athletically, academically and in life.”
